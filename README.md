Classification Subject Perception by EEG Signal Feature.
It was a teamwork project. At first, we create a task by Psychotoolbox Matlab. We record the EEG signals and pre-process them. Then we use different methods to find which properties change when the subject's perception switches. Then we classify by SVM algorithm.
